Zebra Savanna Data Services C# Sample Code
==========================================

This sample code is meant to be used with the [Savanna CSharp SDK](https://github.com/Zebra/Savanna-CSharp-SDK).  It shows basic demos of the main Data Services APIs and how to use the native C# SDK to access them.  For use with Web, Windows, Android, or iOS.  See below for setup of the DataWedge Profile in Zebra Android devices to work with the SDK.

For more information on these APIs, go to [Developer.zebra.com/apis](https://developer.zebra.com/apis) or visit the [Forums](https://developer.zebra.com/forum/search?keys=&field_zebra_curated_tags_tid%5B%5D=273)
